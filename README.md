# Clinical_NLP_Classification

To create Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to automate classification,
prediction and to detect the normality and abnormality in the clinical text reports.

The primary goal of the project is to build a learning model to classify
medical entities such as drug, problem, and anatomy. . It also includes identification
of medical tokens, POS tagging and sentiment of the token. The data for the training
are manually annotated and concatenated from multiple sources and to test the
model medical reports are scrapped from websites.
